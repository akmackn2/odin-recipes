Hello! This is my first project in the field of Web-Development based on HTML. Purpose of this project was to use the HTML skills learned throughout the Odin Project prior to transitioning over to learning CSS and so forth. As a CS student at the University of Houston, I am eager and interested to learn and gain skills in the field of Web-Developing along with my other coding/programming skills in which I feel like The Odin Project is doing a great job at helping me meet my goals. My advice to anyone wanting to learn Web-Development in a self-paced, guided, and organized setting is to check out The Odin Project as its a free resource for anyone interested in learning Web-Development and I'm personally finding it helpful of how it guides me every step of the way with amazing the resources available to make learning Web-Development easier as compared to myself attempting to learn Web-Development from other resources in an interesting setting. This project is primarily about recipes of my selected food items that I found on the website referred by The Odin Project itself, where it is also useful for viewers as it could help y'all try out the recipes given for my selected food items to enjoy!
